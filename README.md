# PGSS 2020 CS Lab Lecture 2 Repo

**This repo contains my notes and code from the CS lab thus far.**


* myFirstScript was an introduction to Colab and python

****What we have done so far:****

Week 1:
- How to set up a development environment on the cloud for the purpose of analysis of data in r and python 
- One click notebooks for python - Google Colab
- Github for code repositories
- How to host a web-page on github pages (github.io...)

Week 2:
- Leveraging Colab to connect to google drive and other data sources on the internet
- Populate tabular pandas data frames for analysis
- Random forest classifier based on Iris data to predict multi-class outcomes of flower types from numeric attributes of the flowers
- Regression and classification
- LIME and SHAP machine learning to understand why something made a specific prediction

Week 3: 
- Ingesting data through forms, google sheets, public datasets, CSV
- Data Munging: Selecting columns of interest, removing rows with missing values
- Modeling: Linear vs Non-linear, supervised vs unsupervised vs reinforcement training
